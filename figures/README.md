# This folder contains three figures for visualizing different parameters from the DIG data
## Figure 1: The serum Potassium Level (KLEVEL) among different age groups and races
It was hypothesized that the KLEVEL will fluctuate between different age groups or among different races (1-White vs. 2-Nonwhite), but the results turned out that it was relatively constant at level around 3-6 mg/l.
Also noted that the sample under age 30 is relatively scarce so the distribution is not obvious compared to group AGE>30.
## Figure 2: Checks the median and outlier of data of patient's EJF_PER-Ejection Fraction from the heart to show the DIG's effects
## Figure 3: Shows the distribution of Heartrate counts among the patients
